# ACSI V0.2

Automated Character Sheet Internationalizer (ACSI) is a simple program to place ['i18n'-language tags](https://wiki.roll20.net/Character_Sheet_i18n) into existing [HTML character sheets](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets) made for the [Roll20 platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll20). The aim is to automate large parts of the currently manual process of introducing `i18n`-tags to existing character sheets, and lower the bar for translating character sheets. 

V0.2 At it's current state, ACSI can only create i18n-tags for the most uniform text sections and normally structured sheets that doesn't contain many line-breaks or special characters.

ACSI written in C, and have some unix commands sprinkled within, so it needs to be run in a linux enviroment to work. 

## Initiate ACSI

Just run `make` command in your command line while in the main directory, and ACSI will compile from the files in the `/src` folder.

### Make options

There exist a few make commands to do other things than just a clean build:

build,b:	builds without removing the .o files
clean,c:	removes all .o files
tclean, tc:	removes all translated files(those with 'i18n-' prefix)
test, t:	builds a `test` instance you can have in parallel with your main `acsi` 

## Use
After running the `make` command, you need to make a copy of the file you want to change and place it in the same folder as ACSI is located.

You can now call ACSI from the command line(when your command line have the ACSI as active directory): `./acsi <filename>` 

You give the ACSI a html filename from the same directory, and ACSI will insert the i18n-tags as it sees fit, then saving the output as a new file with "i18n-"  as prefix.
If everything worked out as it should, it should display a short `ACSI translated <filename> successfully!` on the command line.

## Changelog

### V0.2 (2019-02-18)
- code/file cleanup
- fixed credits typo
- rewrote readme
- html comments, sheetworkers and rolltemplates doesn't  any longer have a negatively impact  when creating `i18n`-tags

### V0.1
- make data tags for text displayed in html elements, `<p>like this text</p>`
- treats all text; comments, roll templates & sheetworkers alike, best to avoid if your sheet contains much of it
- autogenerated tags are at times clumsy, and duplicates may arise as it's currently taken in consideration

## Development roadmap
My primary focus is on implementing the largest timesavers when it comes to creating `i18n`-tags, secondary on things that improve my programming/git habits/workflow and only terrtiary on user friendlyness. When ACSI have reached a good level of automating away the manual human work from character sheet translation, it will only remain in use of very few people, reducing even further any need of streamlining it further from a simple command line thing.

### V0.5 (Alpha)
- makes less mistakes with creating tags
- ignore `cs>` , `cs<` , `cf>`, `cf<` (credits to David for noticing)
- doesn't make duplicate tags

### V.1.0 and beyond
- makes tags for `titles`
- create own `translation.json` files
- push changes make to `translation.json` back to the sheet(for the purpuose of improving the autogenerated tags)
- translate roll templates
- notice if files already are translated, and would only improve on missing things
- translate sheetworkers
- improve ACSI's user friendliness
